# The Aussie Dream Chaser

Our tool aims to provide a concise summary for someone looking to holiday in or move to a particular area in Australia. It will help them evaluate whether or not an area will be able to provide them a slice of their Australian dream.
Our mission is to make a user friendly experience when searching for the Aussie dream.

Our team has designed an original product ‘the Aussie Dream Chaser’ tool that will find your ideal Aussie dream location.

Our tool harnesses this boundless country, by making searching for the ideal Australian Haven easy and accessible for the community.

What are we building?
Our project is the development of a website application. This website aims to enable the general public to utilise open datasets to evaluate potential suburbs to relocate to, or visit for a holiday, based on community facilities in that area.

In addition, local government authorities can also benefit from the data captured by this application to evaluate the demand for certain public facilities. This will aid local councils in planning for future growth and development to meet community demands and increase utilisation of public facilities.
